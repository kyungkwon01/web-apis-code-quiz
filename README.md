# Multiple Choice Quiz

This project is a web-based multiple choice quiz that features a timer and the ability to submit high scores. The user is presented with a series of multiple choice questions, and a timer counts down from a set time limit. If the user answers incorrectly, time is deducted from the timer. Once all questions have been answered, the user can submit their score to a high score board.
